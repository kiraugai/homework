<h2> ABOUT ME </h2>
<p> My name is Kira Ugai and I was born in a small town in Russia in 1992. In 2000, my family made a big move to the Netherlands - where I lived for the most part of my life. During my 2nd year in college I founded my own e-commerce business - <a href="http://development.safety4you.eu/bm/">Beauty Millenium</a> - specialized in beauty products. In order to find manufacturers to produce my merchandise, I traveled to countries such as Greece, Italy, China and Korea. Traveling abroad helped me to acquire a better understanding of different cultures and improved my ability to visualize ideas and convert them into real-life projects.</p>

<p>Last year I graduated from the University of Amsterdam, with a bachelors degree in Communication Science. I decided it was time for a new adventure so I packed my bags and moved to San Francisco, CA - where I am currently residing! Here in SF, I hope to make new connections, gain new skills (such as coding) and collaborate with new brands in order to expand my business further.</p>

<!-- I wanted to make the font of the 'a' elements the same as my 'h4' element, but it didn't know how to do that without making the word 'resume' small as well.. How do you seperate two 'a' tags?-->
